# GMIA Modding Help
This is a Github respository to help you rebuild/mod your own mod based on TheOtherRolesGMIA!  
### Setup
Before you start coding, please look at this start up tutorial first.  
#### Things you need
- Visual Studio Community (Visual Studio Code is also acceptable, but Visual Studio Community is recommended)
- Dotnet Core, Framework (Dotnet 7.0 is the latest release, but as for GMIA, I am using dotnet 6.0)
- Download the following assets from Visual Studio

##### Notion: This is just an example, and if you want to make your mod work, please look at the original versions of your mod.
  
### Coding
Congratulations! You have completed the setup. Now the thing you need to do is, to build the project by clicking on the "Build" button.  
If your code is working properly, you should be able to find a dll file in /TheOtherRoles/Debug/net6.0/  

### Creating your own roles
In order to create your own roles based on The Other Roles GM IA, you have to pay special attention to some cs files, which are: CustomOptionHolder.cs,  
RoleInfo.cs, as well as some other patches.
